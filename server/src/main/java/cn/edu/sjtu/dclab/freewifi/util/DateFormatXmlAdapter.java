/**
 *
 * Hackety hackety hack
 *
 * Hack - our client (Simple XML on Android) doesn't know how to parse much and it'snot easy to teach it how to parse anything
 * since the entire Simple XML API is all package-private classes that are usually also final.
 *
 * So, we change it in JAXB2, which is also difficult. Either we use a {@link javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar}
 * for our data types in our entities (which would both be ugly and possibly cause problems since our entities also need
 * to work with JPA) or we teach JAXB how to 'adapt' a Date to and from a String,  This class is an attempt
 * to do the latter.
